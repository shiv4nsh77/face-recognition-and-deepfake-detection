# Face Recognition and Deepfake Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust system for **facial recognition** and **deepfake detection** using modern machine learning and computer vision techniques. It integrates both technologies to identify individuals accurately and detect manipulated or AI-generated content.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Deepfake video/image detection
- Uses pre-trained models for face embedding and classification
- Visualization of predictions and results
- Modular and extensible Jupyter Notebook-based implementation

## Project Structure

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-deepfake-detection.git
cd face-recognition-deepfake-detection
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the notebook**

Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and run `face_recognisation_and_deepfake_detection.ipynb`.

## How to Use

1. Load your dataset or use sample images/videos provided.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook cell.
3. Train, test, and evaluate models.
4. Visualize face recognition and deepfake detection results.

## Results

- Accuracy: XX% (Recognition), YY% (Deepfake detection)
- Confusion matrices and performance metrics are available in the notebook output.
